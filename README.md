# devs_simulator
simulator using DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) concept (generic simulator)

This maybe will be integrated as service in Chappy.

This will not be a translation of the generic simulator in JAVA.

The xml/json technologies to describe the networks and processors will come from poc_xmlbindings.
